# Eloquent Javascript Solutions

These are solutions by myself, Jaye Heffernan to the exercises provided in the
end of the chapters of Eloquent Javascript, written by Marijn Haverbeke, as
availible at eloquentjavascript.net.  My aim is to develop proficiency in
Javascript and the Javascript workflow, with emphasis on clear coding style and
commenting.

The directory structure is as follows for the first two sets of exercises, and
will likely expand in a similar fashion.
